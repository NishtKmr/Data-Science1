# Data-Science1

Hi All,

My Name is Nishant and I am working at Mutinational company, joined as Desktop Engineer and with the hard work and dedication soon got promoted as Lead.
Since than I' had work with many technology such as Citrix, Exchange, 0365, WSUS and B-power.
3 years ago I heard about Data Science and this interested me alot, I started searching and learning about it.
Soon I figure out that it requires R, Python and statistics. Since I didn't had maths in my 12th Class, I thought this is something which I will never be able to do it.
However, this curiosity to learn did not stopped me, I went to different people to get some help, however all in vain.Then I thought of creating my own path and started my studies again, where I came to know about Data camp and statisisc from Brandon Foltz. This helped in a great deal and gave me confidence that I can also do this.
I am still learning and found about Github, which is playing magnificent role in todays' data science carrier.
Soon after this I analayzing data at my office and started handling a team for the same. We are still learning, since don't have many projects from the clients, we tried to ask different teams for data, to which some agreed and some didn't. Soon after that I realize the data that shared by the team was of now use to us as it was no use to them as well.
Still I am trying to the find something and after few projects with my team, people in our Organization, start recognizing us and soon the follow of data increased however bussiness team were sharing the data as now they came to know about the data science, however never understood the power and science behind, so as I mentioned data was shared with us which was good this time, I would not say better but good.
However the team that shared the data with us didn't had a business requirment, I mean to say they didn't know what they want from this data and I explained them about it and it open the flood gates with questions, most of the were irelevant and however we knew what they were asking. Being honest to my work I tried to understand there question and shared some facts which were mind boggling to them. We had questions from Architect, as everyone in room was trying to prove to the managment that they have expertise in there technology and the proofs that we were sharing were them were good to an extent howeve not true to at all.
I too, didn't want to prove them wrong as well, cause I need the more data from them in future and don't want to break that trust.
Since it was good learning and the me and my team worked was something which was becoming and examples to the Leaders who were in this business since long.
However,it was time for me to start my new carrer with new challenges, where people can use the power of science with the data and make there life and there customer life easier.
would like to share more however just don't want to speak about me all through. As what I understood data science is never about me, it is all about US.
